#Amazon Price Checker

Simple price checker, fill in the watchlist with a list of dictionaries and it will send you an email if any item is available below the target price at the amazon url provided.

Useful if put on a schedule on a service like Heroku.

Note that if you are using gmail to send the emails you may need to enable less secure apps and create an app specific password.
